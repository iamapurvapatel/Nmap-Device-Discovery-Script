# üîç Nmap Secure Log Script

This script runs an Nmap scan against a specified target IP address and securely stores the scan results in a password-protected log file.

## üöÄ Features

- Prompts user for a target IP address to scan.
- Creates a `logs/` directory if it doesn't exist.
- Prompts for a password if the `logs/` directory is being created for the first time.
- Encrypts each Nmap scan result using `zip` with password protection.
- Automatically deletes the unencrypted `.log` file after encryption.
- Password is stored securely in `.log_password` inside the `logs/` folder (for reuse across scans).

## üîí Security Note

> The password is stored in a hidden file inside the `logs/` folder for convenience. This is not secure for production environments. Consider using GPG or another encryption tool for enhanced security.
